Explanation of Relationships

Generative AI: This is the broadest category, encompassing all AI models that generate content.

NLP (Natural Language Processing): This is a subset of Generative AI that specifically deals with processing and understanding human language.

NLU (Natural Language Understanding): A subset of NLP that focuses on comprehending the meaning and context of language.

LLM (Large Language Model): These are large-scale models within NLP and NLU, trained on extensive datasets to perform complex language tasks.

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): This is a specific type of LLM known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
